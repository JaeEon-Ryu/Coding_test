'''
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,4] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,4,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums that may contain duplicates, return the minimum element of this array.

class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # return min(nums)

        # 이진탐색
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1  # index
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2

            if nums[mid] > nums[right]:
                left = mid + 1
            elif nums[mid] < nums[right]:
                right = mid
            else:
                right -= 1

        return nums[left]
